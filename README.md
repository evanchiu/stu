Welcome to the AWS CodeStar sample web application
==================================================

This sample code helps get you started with a simple Node.js web service deployed by AWS CloudFormation to AWS Lambda and Amazon API Gateway.

What's Here
-----------

This sample includes:

* README.md - this file
* buildspec.yml - this file is used by AWS CodeBuild to package your
  application for deployment to AWS Lambda
* index.js - this file contains the sample Node.js code for the web service
* template.yml - this file contains the Serverless Application Model (SAM) used
  by AWS Cloudformation to deploy your application to AWS Lambda and Amazon API
  Gateway.


What Do I Do Next?
------------------

If you have checked out a local copy of your repository you can start making
changes to the sample code.  We suggest making a small change to index.js first,
so you can see how changes pushed to your project's repository are automatically
picked up by your project pipeline and deployed to AWS Lambda and Amazon API Gateway.
(You can watch the pipeline progress on your AWS CodeStar project dashboard.)
Once you've seen how that works, start developing your own code, and have fun!
